<br />
<br />
<strong><b id="pp_08">WHAT THIRD-PARTY SERVICES DO WE USE?</b></strong><br />
<br />
Some of the content, advertising, and functionality in our Services is provided by third parties. These third parties may use cookies, beacons, tracking pixels, and other tools to collect information about your use of these Services. These third parties are not controlled directly by Samsung, so we recommend that you check their privacy policies to understand how they use your data. <br />
<br />
For some apps and services, including social networks, we receive and store sign-in information, as well as other information that you allow us to receive when you connect with these apps and services. <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><b id="pp_09">COOKIES, BEACONS, AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</b></strong><br />
<br />
We, along with certain third parties such as content providers and advertisers, may also use technologies called cookies, beacons, or pixels, as well as other tools (collectively known as “technologies”) that communicate information from your device to a server. These technologies can be embedded in online content, videos, and advertisements. They allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular advertisement, and determine the time and date on which you viewed the content as well as information about your device, including the IP address of your device. We, and third parties, use these technologies for purposes such as verifying that content and ads have been delivered and viewed correctly. <br />
<br />
<u>Cookies</u><br />
<br />
Cookies are small files that store information on your computer, TV, mobile phone, or other devices. They enable the entity that put the cookie on your device to recognize you across different websites, services, devices, and browsing sessions. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:<br />
<br />
• Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter them each time you log on to a service.<br />
• Cookies help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us to see which pages and features visitors are accessing and how much time they are spending on the pages. Studying this information helps us to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.<br />
• Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so you do not get the same ad each time you access a Service.<br />
• Cookies help us and third parties provide you with relevant content and advertising by collecting information about your use of our Services and other websites and apps.<br />
<br />
We may allow carefully selected third parties to place cookies or similar technologies on our Services. For example, and without limitation, we use Google remarketing tags to allow our retail partners to advertise products which you have browsed on our website. You can learn more about how Google remarketing tags work here: <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/" target="_blank">https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-gb/</a>. In addition, third parties such as Facebook may place cookies to track you across applicable websites and across other websites. <br />
<br />
We may also work with carefully selected business partners to deliver advertising jointly. This may involve combining cookie data collected from our website with data collected by our business partner. We may also use information collected to understand our customers’ preferences and to influence future advertising campaigns including how we select who we direct our marketing to.<br />
<br />
We, and our carefully selected business partners, may place cookies when we show ads for our products or services on third-party websites and when you click on those ads, so we know which sites and ads our customers have seen and which ads have been interacted with. You may be able to adjust your preferences in relation to these cookies on those third-party sites. <br />
<br />
<strong>Third party cookies</strong>: Our Services may also display content from a third party website or service, which may result in cookies from third parties being stored on your device. You can manage your preferences for these third parties in the same way as for Samsung cookies. Please see below for more details on how to manage your preferences. We do not control the storage and use of these cookies by these third parties, and you should refer to the privacy policies of the relevant third parties for more information. <br />
<br />
<u>Beacons and Pixels</u><br />
<br />
We, along with certain third parties, use technologies called beacons or pixels that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, ads, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, and determine the time and date on which you viewed relevant content as well as the IP address of your device. We and certain third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and, along with other information, to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.<br />
<br />
<u>Other Local Storage</u><br />
<br />
We, along with certain third parties, use other kinds of local storage technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as Flash cookies) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above. They are stored on your devices and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For information about disabling or deleting information contained in Local Shared Objects, visit <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html" target="_blank">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html</a>.<br />
<br />
Cookies are retained for no longer than necessary to provide the function for which they are used. This will vary depending on the specific Service. For example, a cookie to authenticate log-in may be kept for a longer period of time than a cookie used to allow you to place items in a shopping basket as a guest on our website.<br />
<br />
<u>How to manage your preferences</u><br />
<br />
Where we use these technologies on our Services, you can manage your preferences at any time. However, some technologies are essential or necessary to run the Service and cannot be changed. Visit the settings or cookie preference menu on the relevant Services or on your device for more information on how to manage these options. <br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><b id="pp_10">INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING SERVICES</b></strong><br />
<br />
Many of our Services may include an interest-based advertising service. When such an interest-based advertising service is enabled, in addition to this Privacy Policy, an additional privacy notice will also apply to our collection, use, and disclosure of information in connection with such service.<br />
<br />
